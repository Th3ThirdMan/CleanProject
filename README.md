# Clean and Lean Blog

This is a full-stack project employing the programming and framework tools Django, Bootstrap, Python, HTML and CSS. The primary goals of the project were to provide a fully functioning and responsive website allowing users the ability to post up recipes, comment on recipes and also provide the option for users to like or unlike recipes.
<br><br>

## Site Overview

The Clean and Lean Blog is a site created with the intention of providing information on exciting recipes and also offering the user an opportunity to post up their own recipe ideas that they would like to share with other enthusiasts. The resource is created for those who enjoy cooking. It is designed to give a user a degree of knowledge and inspiration when it comes to all things culinary.
<br><br>

It is a website designed to be interacted with by people of all ages who have a keen interest in food and its use serves to provide a fun and interesting experience for those passionate about this artform.
<br><br>

The Home page of the blog is the primary source that reflects a strong and appealing visual of what the website is all about. The opening title highlights a relationship to the content and allows a user to create an account to allow them access to post up their own recipes.

The Home page gives a user the option to sign up to view and post up receipes or alternatively, sign in should they be a previously registered user on the site.

# Design

<br>

## Colour Schemes

<br>

* For the colour schema of the website I initially drew from a personal aesthetic that I felt could work well as a quiz. I mixed and matched colours that I felt coincided well off the palette but as the project was partially based on a theme I decided to go with colours that complimented the thematic background image. To mirror the retro colourway of the other elements on the site I used Pixlr to grab the original logo colours. This worked well and gave the quiz a more vibrant and fun feel, which is the desired effect of a quiz endeavour. The primary trio of colours were as follows: #fcff4a, #4f61d5, #61b03f.

* In addition to the 3 colours dedicated to the entirety of the quiz pages a rgb(253, 246, 180) was utilised as a background colour in the quiz section. A white background did initially suffice here but I felt it needed more refining. This colour worked better when dropped behind the yellow quiz box.

* Hover options on buttons employed the primary colours set for the project, specifically matched to the NTWICM logo.

<br>

## Font Families

<br>

* Font Families included Lato and sans serif. It added a clarity and refinedness that the pages deserved. 

<br><br>

# Features

<br>

## The Home Page

<br>

  * The Home Page consists of the Clean and Lean brand name logo set as a background with a simple box outlining the nature of the site, how many questions are to be answered, and the means to progress on through to the quiz. 

  * An opacity element was integrated into the inner box feature allowing more transparency to view the background.

  # Bugs

  <br>

  * I encountered a few issues where the site didn't meet my intended expectations. This primarily resided in the arena of responsiveness when viewing the screen at mobile level. The Summernote default widget form was difficult to  didn't render seamlessly in a landscape view. A fix for this was to dispense with static height and width properties that were yielding limitations when added to the body.
