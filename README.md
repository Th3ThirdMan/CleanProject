# Clean and Lean Blog

This is a full-stack project employing the programming and framework tools Django, Bootstrap, Python, HTML and CSS. The primary goals of the project were to provide a fully functioning and responsive website allowing users the ability to post up recipes, comment on recipes and also provide the option for users to like or unlike recipes.
<br><br>

## Site Overview

The Clean and Lean Blog is a site created with the intention of providing information on exciting recipes and also offering the user an opportunity to post up their own recipe ideas that they would like to share with other enthusiasts. The resource is created for those who enjoy cooking. It is designed to give a user a degree of knowledge and inspiration when it comes to all things culinary.
<br><br>

It is a website designed to be interacted with by people of all ages who have a keen interest in food and its use serves to provide a fun and interesting experience for those passionate about this artform.
<br><br>

The Home page of the blog is the primary source that reflects a strong and appealing visual of what the website is all about. The opening title highlights a relationship to the content and allows a user to create an account to allow them access to post up their own recipes. The Home page also gives a user the option to sign in should they be a previously registered user on the site.

# Design

<br>

## Colour Schemes

<br>

* For the colour schema of the website I wanted to introduce a rich and rustic surround to the site. The landing page image was indicative of how I perceived the whole project concept, warm and inviting, to tie in accurately with the recipes offered in the site. 

* As the website landing page image is a notable feature on first viewing it didn't need too much of a remove when deciding appropriate colours to co-incide with the visual of the website. Button colours and the Brand lettering worked well with rgb(255, 165, 0). For the card recipes this was offset subtly with rgb(251, 241, 222), giving not much in the way of a large remove on subsequent pages.

* Hover options on buttons employed slight contrasts to original button colours.

<br>

## Font Families

<br>

* Font Families included Lato, Roboto and Sans Serif. It added a clarity and refinedness that the pages deserved. 

<br><br>

  # Future Features

  # Bugs

  <br>

  * I encountered a few issues where the site didn't meet my intended expectations. This primarily resided in the arena of responsiveness when viewing the screen at mobile level. The Summernote default widget form was difficult to  didn't render seamlessly in a landscape view. A fix for this was to dispense with static height and width properties that were yielding limitations when added to the body.
